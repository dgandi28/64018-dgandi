# Problem

The Weigelt Corporation has three branch plants with excess production capacity. Fortunately,the corporation has a new product ready to begin production, and all three plants have this capability, so some of the excess capacity can be used in this way. This product can be made in three sizes--large, medium, and small--that yield a net unit profit of $420, $360, and $300, respectively. Plants 1, 2, and 3 have the excess capacity to produce 750, 900, and 450 units per day of this product, respectively, regardless of the size or combination of sizes involved. The amount of available in-process storage space also imposes a limitation on the production rates of the new product. Plants 1, 2, and 3 have 13,000, 12,000, and 5,000 square feet,respectively, of in-process storage space available for day's production of this product. Each unit of the large, medium, and small sizes produced per day requires 20, 15, and 12 square feet, respectively. Sales forecasts indicate that if available, 900, 1,200, and 750 units of the large, medium, and small sizes, respectively, would be sold per day. At each plant, some employees will need to be laid off unless most of the plant’s excess production capacity can be used to produce the new product. To avoid layoffs if possible,management has decided that the plants should use the same percentage of their excess capacity to produce the new product. Management wishes to know how much of each of the sizes should be produced by each of the plants to maximize profit.

## LP Model

**Create table** 

```{R}
Industries = matrix(c(750, 13000, 900, 12000, 450, 5000), byrow = TRUE, nrow =3)

colnames(Industries) = c("Capacity", "Square_feet") 

rownames(Industries) = c("Plant1", "Plant2", "Plant3") 

Result1= as.table(Industries) 

Result1 

Z = matrix(c( 20, 900, "$420", 15, 1200, "$360", 12, 750, "$900"), byrow= TRUE, nrow = 3) 

colnames(Z) = c("Square_feet", "Sales", "Profit") 

rownames(Z) = c("Large", "Medium", "Small") 

Result2 = as.table(Z) 

Result2
```

## Define the decision variables 

The Weigelt Corporation has three types of plant. 

The dimensions for the products are Large, Medium and Small that are produced in respective plants. 

Considering that, the no.of Large size products in plant 1 = $𝐹1_𝐿$

Assume number of Medium size products in plant 1 = $𝐹1_𝑀$

Assume number of Small size products in plant 1 = $𝐹1_𝑆$

Assume number of Large size products in plant 2 = $𝐹2_𝐿$ 

Assume number of Medium size products in plant 2 = $𝐹2_𝑀$ 

Assume number of Small size products in plant 2 = $𝐹2_𝑆$

Assume number of Large size products in plant 3 = $𝐹3_𝐿$ 

Assume number of Medium size products in plant 3 = $𝐹3_𝑀$ 

Assume number of Small size products in plant 3 = $𝐹3_𝑆$ 

The Decision Variable are:

$𝐹1_𝐿,𝐹1_𝑀,𝐹1_𝑆,𝐹2_𝐿,𝐹2_𝑀,𝐹2_𝑆,𝐹3_𝐿,𝐹3_𝑀,𝐹3_𝑆$

## Objective Function

The maximum quantity of each size to be produced by the individual plants to increase revenue: 

$𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑍=420(𝐹1_L+𝐹2_L+𝐹3_L)+360(𝐹1_M+𝐹2_M+𝐹3_M)+300(𝐹1_S+𝐹2_S+𝐹3_S)$

## Constraints 

**Capacity Constraints: **

Capacity constraint for plant1 : $𝐹1_𝐿+𝐹1_𝑀+𝐹1_𝑆<=750$

Capacity constraint for plant2 : $𝐹2_𝐿+𝐹2_𝑀+𝐹2_𝑆<=900$ 

Capacity constraint for plant3 : $𝐹3_𝐿+𝐹3_𝑀+𝐹3_𝑆<=450$ 

**Storage Constraints: **

Storage constraint for plant1 : $20𝐹1_L+15𝐹1_M+12𝐹1_S<=13000$

Storage constraint for plant2 : $20𝐹2_L+15𝐹2_M+12𝐹2_S<=12000$ 

Storage constraint for plant3 : $20𝐹3_𝐿+15𝐹3_𝑀+12𝐹3_𝑆<=5000$ 

**Sales Constraint: **

***Sales constraint of product produced in Large size :***

$𝐹1_𝐿+𝐹2_𝐿+𝐹3_𝐿<=900$ 

***Sales constraint of product produced in Medium size :***

$𝐹1_𝑀+𝐹2_𝑀+𝐹3_𝑀<=1200$ 

***Sales constraint of product produced in Small size : ***

$𝐹1_𝑆+𝐹2_𝑆+𝐹3_𝑆<=750$ 

**Same capacity constraints:**

To generate the new product ,the plants should utilize the same proportion of their surplus capacity according to the management:

$𝐹1_L+𝐹1_M+𝐹1_S/750=𝐹2_L+𝐹2_M+𝐹2_S/900=𝐹3_L+𝐹3_M+𝐹3_S/450$ 

**Non negativity of variable: ** 

$𝐹1_𝐿,𝐹1_𝑀,𝐹1_𝑆,𝐹2_𝐿,𝐹2_𝑀,𝐹2_𝑆,𝐹3_𝐿,𝐹3_𝑀,𝐹3_𝑆>=0$
